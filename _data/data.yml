    title: About Me
    summary: |
      As a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems in Vanderbilt University, 
      I specialize in <strong>decision optimization</strong> within the field of public transportation. 
      My work focuses on modeling problems as Markov decision processes and utilizing algorithms such
      as Monte Carlo tree search and reinforcement learning to find optimal solutions. 
      Additionally, I have extensive experience working in the field of <strong>cyber-physical systems</strong>, 
      where I apply cutting-edge technologies to drive further innovation.
      
      I work closely with multiple industry partners and solve complex issues through research while at the same time leading multiple grad students in their research that attempts to solve real-world issues through the application of state-of-the-art research:
      * <strong>Optimizing public transit substitute bus stationing and dispatching behaviors</strong>. In charge of implementing occupancy prediction using machine learning models and developing algorithms to improve stationing and dispatch of substitute buses. I work closely with the transit agency to develop usable tools (historical and real-time bus dashboards) and create data processing pipelines to improve public transit monitoring and response. I also lead multiple graduate students with machine learning and optimization research for public transit.
      * Currently leading a team of grad students and engineers in working with an EV manufacturing company to <strong>optimize their charger behaviors</strong> using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Reinforcement Learning approaches to lower costs while meeting user requests. I'm in charge of developing a dashboard, custom-built for the company's use case, that will host different tools such as a charging policy simulator built over research work done by the team.

        time: 2017-2020
        details: |
          I received my PhD under a Japanese Government Scholarship. I was a member of the Ubiquitous Computing Systems laboratory
          where my research centered around middleware systems for resource-constrained devices with a focus on smart transportation. 
          I have a strong background in both theoretical and practical applications of 
          computer science, primarily in <strong>distributed computing</strong> and am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of innovation in this field.
            - Dissertation: <i>Design and Implementation of Decentralized Smart City Services on the Edge</i>
      - degree: MSc in Electronics Engineering
        university: Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines
        time: 2013 - 2015
        details: |
          I worked on designing and creating a prototype of what we deemed "near cloud" which is a low-cost, local cloud 
          device meant to be deployed in rural areas in the Philippines. These devices are meant to hold terabytes of information
          that can be accessed to custom designed services. We targeted various aspects of the community such as health, education, and agriculture, with the 
          intention of integrating them into a cyber-physical system of smart instruments for a smart connected community.
            - Dissertation: <i>Design, Development and Demonstration of a Highly Interactive Near Cloud Architecture for Institutions over Wireless Connectivity</i>
