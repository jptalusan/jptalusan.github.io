career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Software Information Systems in Vanderbilt University, 
      I specialize in <strong>decision optimization within the field of public transportation</strong>. 
      My work focuses on modeling problems as Markov decision processes and utilizing algorithms such
      as Monte Carlo tree search and reinforcement learning to find optimal solutions. 
      Additionally, I have extensive experience working in the field of <strong>cyber-physical systems</strong>, 
      where I apply cutting-edge technologies to drive further innovation.
      Overall, my research interests lie in the intersection of computer science and transportation.
      
education:

    info:
      - degree: Doctor of Engineering
        university: Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan
        time: 2017-2020
        details: |
          I received my PhD in Japan, where my research centered around
          middleware systems for resource-constrained devices with a focus on smart transportation. 
          I have a strong background in both theoretical and practical applications of 
          computer science and am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of innovation in this field.
            - Dissertation: Design and Implementation of Decentralized Smart City Services on the Edge
            - Japanese Government Scholarship
      - degree: MSc in Electronics Engineering
        university: Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines
        time: 2013 - 2015
        details: |
          I worked on designing and creating a prototype of what we deemed "near cloud" which is a low-cost, local cloud 
          device meant to be deployed in rural areas in the Philippines. These devices are meant to hold terabytes of information
          that can be accessed to custom designed services. We targeted various aspects of the community such as health, education, and agriculture, with the 
          intention of integrating them into a cyber-physical system of smart instruments for a smart connected community.
