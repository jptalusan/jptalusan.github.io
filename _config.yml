  Hi, my name's JP and I'm currently a Postdoc in Vanderbilt University, working under the Institute of Software Integrated Systems. I work mainly on cyber-physical systems, focusing on data analysis, middleware development and smart transportation Systems. Before this, I have finished my PhD in Nara, Japan, working in the Ubiquitous Computing Systems laboratory.

  I am skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>middleware</mark>. Currently working on improving my knowledge on <mark>data analytics</mark>, <mark>machine learning</mark> and to some extent, the statistics behind it. Access my complete CV [here](/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
